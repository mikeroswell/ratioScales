Description: Logarithmic rescaling makes multiplicative relationships additive, 
  and enables clear visual communication of proprtional change. However, the two 
  ways that logarithmic rescaling has traditionally been displayed on graphs can 
  lead to confusion. These two ways are 1) rescaling the data logarithmically, 
  and marking axes with the log-transformed values, and 2) rescaling the data 
  logarithmically, but marking the axes with the back-transformed values 
  matching the original scale of the data. **ratioScales** provides **ggplot2**-
  friendly alternatives that highlight multiplicate change explicitly. Three 
  families of tickmark are provided: `divMult` explicitly marks axes with the 
  multiplicative change relative to a reference point (e.g. 
  \eqn{\times 2, \div 2}); `nel`  and `centiNel` mark axes with the 
  multiplicative change in units of natural logarithms ("nels"); `propDiff` and 
  `percDiff` mark axes with the proportional difference from the reference 
  point. General functions `scale_y_ratio()` and `scale_x_ratio()` can be added 
  to a ggplot object to use the ratio-scaled axes.
